# email-spam-classifier
This project is a Machine Learning-based Email Spam Classifier that automatically detects whether a message is spam or not spam (ham).

The model is trained on labeled text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF). After feature extraction, a classification algorithm Naive Bayes is used to accurately classify incoming messages.
